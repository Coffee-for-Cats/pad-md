# pad-md
 A notepad app for desktop, developed in Electron, with TS/JS, HTML and CSS.
 It uses marked.js for compiling plain text to html. No user input filtering is being done so you should not open files from sources you don't trust.
 
 By installation, windows will try to "protect your pc"; this happens because I don't have money to buy a license; the program WILL **NOT** damage your pc, and will **NOT** get any information from it.
 If you don't believe me, download the source code and use `npm run make` to build the installer with electron-forge.
 
 It is only supported in windows till now.
