# pad-md
 A notepad app for desktop, developed in Electron, with TS/JS, HTML and CSS.
 
 The notepad suports markdown formating:
 - titles and subtitles (# and ## / ###)
 - list itens (-). 
 _Note that only putting a space next to the above modifiers really apply them._
 - inline bold (**)
 
 By installation, windows will try to "protect your pc"; this happens because I don't have money to buy a license; the program WILL **NOT** damage your pc, and will **NOT** get any information from it.
 If you don't believe me, download the source code and use `npm run make` to build the installer with electron-forge.
 
 It is only supported in windows till now.
